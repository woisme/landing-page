    <h3>About The Refurbishment</h3>
    <p>
        The University Arms Cambridge has been a striking feature on the landscape of this iconic city since 1834. However at the end of September 2014 this grand old dame closed her doors for an exciting and extensive refurbishment.

        The aim of the new owners is to completely transform the rather disparate buildings that currently comprise the University Arms into a stunning, landmark property that will offer some of the best facilities in Cambridge.  The rather unattractive 1960's and 1970's extensions will be replaced by a timeless, classic building with a dramatic porte cochere.  And with an elegant new interior to match, the University Arms Cambridge will be set to take its place at the forefront of the Cambridge hospitality scene.
